# Image Classification Ai Model for Happy and Sad Faces with Machine Learning

This project involves building an AI model for classifying images as happy or sad faces. The model is trained using almost 2,000 portrait pictures from Google search results.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to build and train the model:

Tensorflow
Pandas
Matplotlib
cv2
imghdr
os
Numpy
Neural Network Training Models Used
## The following neural network training models were used in building the AI model:

Sequential
Conv2D
MaxPooling2D
Dense
Flatten
Dropout
Training Results
## The model was trained for 30 epochs, and achieved the following results:

Loss: 0.0206
Accuracy: 0.9908
Validation Loss: 1.1787
Validation Accuracy: 0.8047
Overall, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning and AI in image classification tasks. By training a model on a dataset of images, we can teach the model to accurately classify new images that it has never seen before.

## main goal 

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to classify images based on their emotional content. By accurately identifying whether a person is happy or sad based on their facial expression, this technology could potentially be used in a variety of applications, such as monitoring mental health or analyzing customer satisfaction in retail environments.

## the Pictures selected with Poker face but the machine Predict it with very high accurecy to SAD FACE. 
### Note that. the model only predicting on to major  " SAD " and " HAPPY " Faces.
