# Image Classification AI Model for Happy and Sad Faces with Machine Learning
This project aims to build an AI model capable of classifying images as happy or sad faces. The model is trained using nearly 2,000 portrait pictures from Google search results.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were used to build and train the model:

Tensorflow
Pandas
Matplotlib
cv2
imghdr
os
Numpy

## Neural Network Training Models Used
The following neural network training models were used to build the AI model:

Sequential
Conv2D
MaxPooling2D
Dense
Flatten
Dropout
## Training Results
The model was trained for 30 epochs, resulting in the following metrics:

Loss: 0.0206
Accuracy: 0.9908
Validation Loss: 1.1787
Validation Accuracy: 0.8047
## Model Training
#### The model was trained on a dataset consisting of nearly 2,000 portrait pictures from Google search results. The pictures were labeled as either happy or sad faces, based on the emotions depicted on the faces.

## Model Prediction
The model was tested on an unknown image and achieved an impressive prediction accuracy. The picture selected was a poker face, but the model accurately predicted it to be a sad face with high confidence. It is important to note that the model only predicts on two major emotions, happy and sad faces.

## Potential Applications
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques in image classification tasks. By accurately identifying whether a person is happy or sad based on their facial expression, this technology could potentially be used in various applications. For instance, it could be employed in monitoring mental health, analyzing customer satisfaction in retail environments, or even in developing educational tools for people with autism to help recognize emotions.

Conclusion
This project is a perfect example of how machine learning techniques can be utilized in image classification tasks. By training a model on a dataset of images, it can accurately classify new images that it has never seen before. The results achieved in this project can pave the way for more research on the potential use of machine learning techniques in various industries.

## the Pictures selected with Poker face but the machine Predict it with very high accurecy to SAD FACE. 
### Note that. the model only predicting on to major  " SAD " and " HAPPY " Faces.
